    "## Learning Goals    \n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    " - automatically load a catalog of sources\n",
    " - search NASA and non-NASA resources for fully reduced spectra and load them using specutils\n",
    " - store the spectra in a Pandas multiindex dataframe\n",
    " - plot all the spectra of a given source\n",

    "### Motivation\n",
    "A user has a source (or a sample of sources) for which they want to obtain spectra covering ranges of wavelengths from the UV to the far-IR. The large amount of spectra available enables multi-wavelength spectroscopic studies, which is crucial to understand the physics of stars, galaxies, and AGN. However, gathering and analysing spectra is a difficult endeavor as the spectra are distributed over different archives and in addition they have different formats which complicates their handling. This notebook showcases a tool for the user to conveniently query the spectral archives and collect the spectra for a set of objects in a format that can be read in using common software such as the Python `specutils` package. For simplicity, we limit the tool to query already reduced and calibrated spectra. \n",
    "The notebook may focus on the COSMOS field for now, which has a large overlap of spectroscopic surveys such as with SDSS, DESI, Keck, HST, JWST, Spitzer, and Herschel. In addition, the tool enables the capability to search and ingest spectra from Euclid and SPHEREx in the feature. For this to work, the `specutils` functions may have to be update or a wrapper has to be implemented. \n",
