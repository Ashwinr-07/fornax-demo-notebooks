    "### Summary:\n",
    " - model plots after van Velzen et al. 2021, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09391.pdf\n",
    " \n",
    "### Input:\n",
    " - a catalog of CLAGN from the literature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    " - an archival optical + IR + neutrino light curve\n",
    " \n",
    "### Technical Goals:\n",
    " - should be able to run from a clean checkout from github\n",
    " - should be able to automatically download all catalogs & images used\n",
    " - need to have all photometry in the same physical unit\n",
    " - need to have a data structure that is easy to use but holds light curve information (time and units) and is extendable to ML applications\n",
    " - need to have a curated list of catalogs to search for photometry that is generalizeable to other input catalogs\n",
