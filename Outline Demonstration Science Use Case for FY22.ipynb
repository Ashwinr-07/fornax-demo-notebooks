    "# Outline of Demonstration Science Use Case for FY22\n",
    "NASA observatories such as XMM, Chandra, GALEX, HST, Spitzer, WISE, and Herschel have spent significant resources to observe carefully-chosen survey fields for the purpose of enabling a large variety of extragalactic science. High-quality multi-wavelength photometry catalogs from these observations, in combination with ground-based data, are critical for carrying out these science investigations. The best way to create these catalogs is to use data with high spatial resolution to generate positional priors that can be used to optimally extract photometry from data with lower spatial resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a wire-frame notebook that shows the steps required to start with a catalog of positional priors and extract photometry from GALEX and Spitzer imaging, and cross-match with X-ray catalogs to generate a catalog of spectral energy distributions."
